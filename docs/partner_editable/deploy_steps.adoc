Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

[start=3]
. Check the AWS Region thatâ€™s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. 
This is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-name} will be built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

[start=4]
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
[start=5]
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, 
review the default settings and customize them as necessary.
* Parameter: CACertificateID, see instructions for creating a https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/just-in-time-registration-of-device-certificates-on-aws-iot/[certificate authority^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[registering within AWS IoT^].
* Device/client certificate: Use the CA to create certificates for devices. 
The *Common Name* of the device certificate you create should also be the serial number you assign to the device and provide to end users for device activation. 

When the Cloudformation stack is complete, note the value for "DefaultDomain" under "Outputs". The setup process will continue after the initial Cloudformation stack is complete. 
It takes {deployment_time} to set up the full app using AWS Amplify after the first Cloudformation stack is complete. To check on status, login to the AWS Amplify console and select your app. Once the Quick Start is fully deployed, you can create an account with the "DefaultDomain" to view the web portal. 
To set up a custom domain for the web app, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html[Set up custom domains].
