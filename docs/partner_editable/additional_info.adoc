== Postdeployment steps

=== Deploy the web application

As soon as the AWS CloudFormation stack completes, deploy the web application as follows:

. Still in the CloudFormation console, under the *Outputs* tab, note the *DefaultDomain* value. You need this value to view the web application in a later step. 
. Open the AWS Amplify console.
. Open the web application, and wait for it to deploy. Check the CloudFormation stack's status to confirm that the deployment is complete. This process takes about 10 minutes.
. Create an account using the *DefaultDomain* value. 
. (Optional) Set up a custom domain for the web application. For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html[Set up custom domains^].

//TODO Miles, For Step 3, what is the web application called in the UI (exactly)? We should use the name in this step ... and probably elsewhere in this doc. Any reason not to?

//TODO Miles, Please confirm that this section is accurate as I've edited it.

=== Verify the deployment

. Open the AWS IoT console.

. Choose *Manage*, *Thing groups*. Verify that the *prebuilt thing* groups appear (for example, `iotquickstart-Active`, `iotquickstart-inactive`, and `iotquickstart-Quarantine`).

. Choose *Defend*, *Audit*, *Schedules*. Verify that a daily https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender-audit.html[audit^] appears (for example, `dailyaudit-main`).

. Choose *Defend*, *Detect*, *Security profiles*. Verify that an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/dd-detect-ml.html[ML Detect^] security profile appears (for example, `SecurityProfile-152920-main`). This indicates that device behavior is monitored continuously.

=== Connect and verify your IoT devices

. Connect all your devices to AWS IoT. For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-connect-devices.html[Connecting devices to AWS IoT^].
. Open the AWS IoT console.
. Choose *Manage*, *Things*. 
. Verify your IoT devices' certificates and group affiliations. You identify an IoT device by its certificate and common name (serial number).

Each time you connect an IoT device to AWS IoT, the Quick Start performs the following actions: 

* Generates an AWS IoT device using the common name (serial number) from the device's certificate.
* Attaches the certificate to the IoT device.
* Creates an AWS DynamoDB entry using the common name.
* Adds the IoT device to the `iotquickstart-inactive` group with limited permissions.
* Activates the device certificate.

//TODO Miles, Should "Activates" here be "registers"?

For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/just-in-time-registration-of-device-certificates-on-aws-iot/[Just-in-Time Registration of Device Certificates on AWS IoT^].

=== Verify the registration process for the IoT devices 

Verify the device registration process by testing it with a single device. 

//TODO Miles, What do we achieve by looking at just one device?

. Open the AWS Amplify console.  
. Under *All apps*, choose *iotquickstart*.
. Under the *Frontend environments* tab, choose the web application's thumbnail. A browser tab opens with a sign-up page.
. Create an account.
. Log in with your account credentials. A *Register device* page appears.
. Enter a device's serial number, and choose *REGISTER DEVICE*. A message appears, indicating that the device is registered.
. At the left, choose *Devices*. Verify that the registered device appears under *My Devices*.

//TODO Miles, What's an "end-user IoT device" (vs. just "IoT device" or "your device")? - good question I removed end-use from the title because it can be any IoT device that is registered, but leaving this comment in so we can talk about it during the meeting

== Migrate to a production environment

. Use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html[AWS CodeCommit] to customize the web application so that it meets your business needs.

. Onboard your IoT devices at the expected device-connection rate so that you can validate the deployment's processing rate and scale. For resource and API quotas, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html[AWS IoT Core endpoints and quota^].

. Deploy this Quick Start to your production environment.
// So we will talk about this during the meeting, but I think the issue here is we need to show what the difference between a prod and non-prod deployment looks like. Will need Cathy's input here, going to leave the TODO's up.

//TODO Miles, How is Step 1 related to migrating to a production environment? Should this step go in a section called "Customize the web application"? 

//TODO Miles, Step 2 doesn't seem related to migrating to a production environment either. Should this go under "Postdeployment steps"?

//TODO Miles, For Step 3, do we follow the same steps documented under "Launch the Quick Start"? What do people need to know about migrating to a production environment? We need to give a bit of context hereâ€”and earlier if we weren't supposed to launch to production at first.

== Clean up

If you no longer need to register IoT devices using the web application that was created by this Quick Start, delete the web application as follows:

. Open the AWS Amplify console.
. Select the web application, and delete it.
. Open the AWS CloudFormation console, choose the associated stacks, and delete them.

To redeploy the web application, see link:#_deploy_the_web_application[Deploy the web application] earlier in this guide.
