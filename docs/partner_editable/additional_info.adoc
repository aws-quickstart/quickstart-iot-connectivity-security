// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Don’t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them
NOTE: When the Cloudformation stack is complete, note the value for "DefaultDomain" under "Outputs". 
The setup process will continue after the initial Cloudformation stack is complete. 
It takes ~10 min to set up the full app using AWS Amplify after the first Cloudformation stack is complete. To check on status, 
login to the AWS Amplify console and select your app. Once the Quick Start is fully deployed, you can create an account with the "DefaultDomain" to view the web portal. 
To set up a custom domain for the web app, see Set up https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html[custom domains^].

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading
You can validate that your Quick Start is deployed successfully, by logging onto the AWS IoT console to review the initial setup:

1. Navigate to *Manage*, select *Thing Groups* from the left navigation, you should see pre-built thing groups listed on the page, such as ‘iotquickstart-Active’, ‘iotquickstart-inactive’, and ‘iotquickstart-Quarantine’ group.
2. To check cloud-side IoT configurations against AWS security best practices, navigate to *Defend*, select *Audit*, then select *Schedules* from the left navigation, 
you should see a daily https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender-audit.html[audit^] created, such as ‘dailyaudit-main’.
3. To verify that device behavior is being monitored on a continuous basis, navigate to *Defend*, select *Detect*, 
then select *Security Profiles* from the left navigation, you should see an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/dd-detect-ml.html[ML Detect^] 
Security Profile configured, for example ‘SecurityProfile-152920-main’.

Secondly, you can test the device Just-in-Time Registration process included in the Quick Start:

1. Have one device https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-connect-devices.html[connect with your account’s AWS IoT data endpoint^]
2. Once the device connects, the Quick Start performs a sequence of actions on the backend: 
    ** Generates an AWS IoT thing named with the Common Name (serial number) in the provided device certificate
    ** Attaches the device certificate to the created IoT thing
    ** Creates an AWS DynamoDB entry with the same Common Name for the device
    ** Adds the IoT thing to the ‘iotquickstart-inactive’ group’ with limited permissions
    ** Activates the device certificate
3. Then you can verify the IoT thing, its device certificate and its group affiliation in the AWS IoT console by going to *Manage*, then *Things* from the left navigation. Once on this page you can identify the thing by it's certificate Common Name/serial number/thing name.

Finally, you can test the end user device registration process through the AWS Amplify web app included in the Quick Start:

1. Log onto AWS Amplify via the AWS Management console
2. You should see an ‘iotquickstart’ app already created under ‘All apps’; click the app
3. Under the ‘Frontend environments’ tab, click the app image thumbnail and a new browser tab should open
4. Create an account via the newly opened sign-up page
5. Log in with the created account credentials and see a ‘Register Device’ page

* Enter the serial number of the device that was previously connected and registered in AWS IoT and click ‘REGISTER DEVICE’; you should see a confirmation for successful registration
* Click ‘Devices’ in the left panel; you should also see the registered device now listed under ‘My Devices’

== Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading
=== From testing to production workloads
After verifying that the Quick Start is successfully deployed and it functions as intended, you can consider the following for your operational use:

1. Customize the pre-built AWS Amplify app in AWS CodeCommit so that the app meets your business use cases
2.  Onboard IoT devices at the expected device  connection rate of your operations so that you can validate the processing rate and scale of the solution. Reference AWS IoT Core endpoint and quota (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html) for service resource and API quotas. 

Once you are satisfied with the Quick Start’s app customization and load testing, you can deploy the solution in production. 

=== Teardown
1. Navigate to your app within the AWS Amplify console and select to delete the app.
2. Navigate to the AWS Cloudformation console, select the stacks you created as part of the Quick Start and delete the stacks.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles enable you to assign granular access policies and permissions to services and users in the AWS Cloud. 
This Quick Start creates IAM roles that grant the solution’s services, such as AWS Lambda functions, permissions to perform specific actions.

To deploy this Quick Start, you should have admin access, such as AWS managed IAM policy AdministratorAccess. 
After initial deployment, commits to the CodeCommit repository created by this Quick Start will build or update the Cloud infrastructure. To have the ability to update the CodeCommit repository, 
you should have an IAM role with the AWSCodeCommitPowerUser managed policy attached at a minimum.
