==== Prepare your AWS account

Confirm that your AWS account has the permissions required to create the resources listed in the link:#_resource_quotas[Resource quotas] section of this guide.

==== Certify your IoS devices
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-your-CA-cert.html[Create a CA certificate^] for authenticating your IoT device.
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[Register your CA certificate^] with AWS IoT. 
. Use the CA to create device certificates, using each device's serial number for the common name. 

//TODO Miles, What does it mean to "authenticate" a device? We haven't used this term elsewhere in the doc except in the context of client authentication.

//TODO Miles, I created a new section heading here. Is the wording accurate?

//TODO Miles, What's the difference between what we do here vs. postdeployment?

==== Check your AWS Region

Within in your chosen AWS Region, confirm the following: 

* This deployment does not already exist.
* An audit configuration for AWS IoT Device Defender does not already exist. 

// TODO Miles notes: need to check this second one with cathy
