==== Certify your IoS devices
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-your-CA-cert.html[Create a CA certificate^] for authenticating your fleet device.
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[Register your CA certificate^] with AWS IoT.

//TODO Miles, I created a new section heading here. Is the wording accurate?

==== Check your AWS Region

Within in your chosen AWS Region, confirm the following:
