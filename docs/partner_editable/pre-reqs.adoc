==== Prepare your AWS account

Confirm that your AWS account has the permissions required to create the resources listed in the link:#_resource_quotas[Resource quotas] section of this guide.

==== Create JITR-ready device certificates

Any device certificate (client certificate) issued by your certificate authority (CA) can be registered with AWS IoT. Create JITR-ready device certificates—that is, certificates that will be automatically registered and activated whenever you connect the devices to AWS IoT for the first time—as described in this blog post: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/just-in-time-registration-of-device-certificates-on-aws-iot/[Just-in-Time Registration of Device Certificates on AWS IoT^].

==== Check your AWS Region

Within your chosen AWS Region, confirm the following: 

* This deployment does not already exist.
* An audit configuration for AWS IoT Device Defender does not already exist.
