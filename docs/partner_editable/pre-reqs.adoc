==== Prepare your AWS account

Confirm that your AWS account has the permissions required to create the resources listed in the link:#_resource_quotas[Resource quotas] section of this guide.

==== Create device certificates for the IoT devices

Any device (client) certificate that's issued by your certificate authority (CA) can be registered with AWS IoT and used for client authentication. To create JITR-ready device certificates—certificates that are registered automatically whenever you connect the devices to AWS IoT—follow these steps.

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[Register your CA certificate^] with AWS IoT.

//TODO Miles or Cathy, Do we need a step to configure the CA certificate to support automatic registration of the client certificates (as mentioned on this webpage: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/auto-register-device-cert.html)?

//TODO Miles or Cathy, Do we need a final step for installing the device (client) certificates on the devices (as mentioned in the blog post)?

==== Check your AWS Region

Within in your chosen AWS Region, confirm the following: 

* This deployment does not already exist.
* An audit configuration for AWS IoT Device Defender does not already exist.
