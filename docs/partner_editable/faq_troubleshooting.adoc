*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, confirm that the stack is not already deployed in your selected Region. Also confirm that the audit configuration for AWS IoT Device Defender is not already set up in your selected Region. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

'''
*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another Amazon S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].


== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with this deployment or its features, ensure that your deployment is set up correctly by checking the following:

* Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and confirm that the AWS Amplify web application is deployed.
* Confirm that you registered your CA certificate and that the correct `CACertificateID` is listed in the AWS CloudFormation template. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[Register your CA certificate^].

//TODO Miles, In bullet 1, why do we call this an "AWS Amplify web application" here? We don't do that elsewhere.

//TODO Miles, What are the substeps for bullet 1?
