== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

*or*

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you check that IoT Device Defender Audit Configuration 
is not already set up in the region you are deploying this stack and that you have not already deployed this stack in the same region.

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].


== Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with the Quick Start deployment or the built features (e.g., AWS IoT resource configuration, Amplify app functionality), there are a couple of things you can check to ensure that your deployment is set up correctly:

* Confirm in the AWS management console that the Amplify web app is deployed successfully 
* Check if the Quick Start main CloudFormation template uses the correct parameter, for example verify that the project repository URL is correct
* Confirm the correct CA is  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-CA-cert.html[registered within AWS IoT^] and the correct CACertificateID is used in the main CloudFormation template
