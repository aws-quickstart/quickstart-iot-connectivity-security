== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you check to make sure that IoT Device Defender Audit Configuration is not setup in the region you are deploying this stack and that you have not already deployed this stack in the same region.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].
