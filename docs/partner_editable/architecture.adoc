.IoT {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start architecture diagram
image::../images/iot-connectivity-security-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture, 90%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS IoT Core, which uses device shadows to provide command and control of IoT devices.
* AWS Lambda functions:
** A just-in-time registration (JITR) function that registers (activates) IoT device certificates that were issued by your certificate authority (CA). This registration happens automatically whenever you connect a device to AWS IoT.
** A command-and-control function that updates the device shadows. 
** A function that queries IoT devices and device telemetry.
* Amazon DynamoDB, which stores device telemetry data.
* AWS IoT Device Management, which you use to organize, monitor, and manage IoT devices.
* AWS IoT Device Defender, which audits device cloud-side configurations against AWS security best practices. This service also monitors device behaviors for anomalies after the devices are connected with AWS IoT Core.
* Amazon API Gateway endpoints for device registration, command and control, and queries.
* Amazon Cognito, which manages the identities of the IoT devices' users so that they can sign in to the web application.
* An AWS CodeCommit repository. You can customize the web application by committing changes to this repository.
* An AWS Amplify continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for use by the AWS CodeCommit repository. You use this pipeline when you customize the web application.  
* A web application used by consumers—the device purchasers—to register (activate) their devices, control them, and view telemetry data.
