Many IoT customers find that it is a complex process to get started with AWS IoT and implement the related security features. 
This Quick Start solution addresses this problem and automates the process of provisioning and securing consumer devices for development, 
test, or production purpose. Specifically, it sets up just-in-time device provisioning, enables device connectivity and messaging, deploys a web app for device registration, 
telemetry, command and control, defines cloud-side configuration based on security best practices. This quickstart also sets up security auditing, 
monitoring and mitigation on devices. 
This Quick Start uses AWS IoT Core, Device Management, Device Defender and other AWS services.
In addition, the Quick Start is deployed to an AWS CodeCommit repo with an AWS Amplify CI/CD pipeline that allows customers to customize their deployment by commiting changes to the Amplify project in their repo.
