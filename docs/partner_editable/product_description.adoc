Getting started with AWS IoT and implementing the related security features can be a complex process. This Quick Start reduces this complexity by automating the process of provisioning and helping IoT customers secure consumer devices for development, test, or production purposes. 

Specifically, this Quick Start sets up just-in-time device provisioning; enables device connectivity and messaging; deploys a web application for device registration, telemetry, and command and control; defines cloud-side configuration based on security best practices; and sets up security auditing, monitoring and mitigation on devices.

//TODO Tony, Want to name the web application above?

This Quick Start uses AWS IoT Core, Device Management, Device Defender and other AWS services. In addition, the Quick Start is deployed to an AWS CodeCommit repo with an AWS Amplify CI/CD pipeline so that you can customize your deployment by committing changes to the Amplify project in your repo.
